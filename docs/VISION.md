I need to develop a secure P2P messaging and communication web application called "WSPR" (Web Secure P2P Relay). Please help me create a robust, secure, and well-structured application with the following requirements:

Core Security Requirements:
1. End-to-end encryption (E2EE) using state-of-the-art cryptography (e.g., Signal Protocol)
2. Perfect forward secrecy
3. Zero-knowledge architecture
4. Secure key exchange mechanisms
5. Encrypted data storage
6. Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
7. Implementation of secure WebRTC for real-time communications

Core Features:
1. User Management
   - Secure registration with email verification
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management
   - Profile creation and management
   - Account recovery mechanisms

2. Contacts System
   - Contact adding/removal
   - Contact verification
   - Contact blocking
   - Privacy settings management
   - Contact discovery mechanisms

3. Messaging Features
   - One-on-one encrypted messaging
   - Group messaging
   - Message status (sent/delivered/read)
   - Message deletion (for both parties)
   - Message forwarding
   - Rich text formatting
   - Emoji support
   - Reply threading
   - Message search

4. Media & File Sharing
   - Secure file transfer
   - Image sharing with compression
   - Video sharing
   - Document sharing
   - Voice messages
   - File preview capabilities

5. Real-time Communication
   - Secure video calling (1-on-1)
   - Group video conferencing
   - Screen sharing
   - Audio-only calls
   - Call recording (with proper consent)

6. Group Management
   - Group creation/deletion
   - Member management
   - Admin controls
   - Group privacy settings
   - Group invite mechanisms

Project Structure Requirements:
1. Create a well-organized directory structure following best practices
2. Implement a clean architecture pattern (e.g., MVC or MVVM)
3. Separate concerns between frontend, backend, and security layers
4. Include proper configuration management
5. Set up development, staging, and production environments

Documentation Requirements:
1. Project Documentation
   - Comprehensive README.md
   - Architecture documentation
   - API documentation
   - Security implementation details
   - Development setup guide
   - Deployment guide

2. Code Documentation
   - Inline code comments
   - Function/method documentation
   - Module documentation
   - Type definitions
   - Code style guide

3. Project Management Documentation
   - Project roadmap
   - Feature checklist
   - Sprint planning documents
   - Bug tracking system
   - Change log
   - Version control guidelines

Technical Stack Preferences:
1. Modern, secure, and widely-supported technologies
2. Scalable architecture
3. Cross-platform compatibility
4. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
5. Efficient real-time communication protocols

Development Process Requirements:
1. Set up proper version control with Git
2. Implement automated testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Security tests
   - Performance tests
3. CI/CD pipeline setup
4. Code quality checks
5. Security auditing tools
6. Performance monitoring

Please help me:
1. Set up the initial project structure
2. Create necessary documentation templates
3. Implement the core security architecture
4. Begin with the user management system
5. Provide guidance on best practices and potential security pitfalls

Focus on creating a maintainable, secure, and scalable codebase that can be easily understood and extended by other developers.
